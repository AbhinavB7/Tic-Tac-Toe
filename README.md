# Tic-Tac-Toe
There will be two players in a game. Two signs represent each player. The general signs used in the game are X and O. Finally, there will be a board with 9 boxes.
An infinite loop that breaks when the game is over (either win or draw).
The game will ask if we want to restart the game, If yes a new will start, If no the code will end.
